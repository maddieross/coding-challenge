The website keeps track of employees and dependets and the amount deducted from payroll for benefits. To begin using the application a 
user would created an account so employee and dependent information can be saved. Once an account has been created the user can add 
employee information (name, paycheck amount, number of dependents). The information is saved in a database so that it can be accessed later
to create a preview of the benefit deduction.If the employee has dependents the user will be directed to a new form to enter the name of
the dependent. Once the dependents information is saved the total deduction of benefits will be calculated be adding the employees
dependents deduction plus their deduction and this value will be saved in the database under the employee as theirtotal deduction. Once the
user has entered all their employees information, they can view the preview page thatwill display the employees in a table with the amount
of benefit deduction, paycheck, amount that will be deducted each pay check, and the paycheck amount before taxes.
