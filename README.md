To begin using the application a user would created an account so employee and dependent information can be saved.
Once an account has been created the user can add employee information (name, paycheck amount, number of dependents). 
The information is saved in a database so that it can be accessed later to create a preview of the benefit deduction.
If the employee has dependents the user will be directed to a new form to enter the name of the dependent. If the 
employees name begins with an "A" the deduction amount with be reduced by 10%. The same calculation will be 
applied to dependents names beginning with "A" and this amount will be saved in the dependent database. Once the 
dependents information is saved the total deduction of benefits will be calculated be adding the employees
dependents deduction plus their deduction and this value will be saved in the database under the employee as their
total deduction. Once the user has entered all their employees information, they can view the preview page that
will display the employees in a table with the amount of benefit deduction, paycheck, amount that will be 
deducted each pay check, and the paycheck amount before taxes. 

A test account has been created and populated with employees and dependents.
